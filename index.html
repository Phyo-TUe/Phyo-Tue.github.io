<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am Pyae Pyae Phyo is a postdoc researcher, mentored by Prof. <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/koen-kok">Koen Kok</a> and <a href="https://www.nikospaterakis.com/">Nikolaos Paterakis</a> with the research group Electrical Energy Systems (EES) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands.</p>
<p> I received my Ph.D. and M.Sc. majoring in Engineering and Technology at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat University, in 2021 and 2017, respectively. I graduated with a B.Eng. in Electrical Power Engineering from Mandalay Technological University in 2013. I received the Excellent Foreign Student (EFS) scholarship award throughout my graduate studies. During my Ph.D. study, I joined a machine learning camp (MLC) 2018 in South Korea. Moreover, I was awarded a Canada-ASEAN Scholarships and Educational Exchanges for Development (SEED) to research at the University of Calgary, Canada, in 2019. I previously worked as a machine learning (ML) researcher at the ML lab at Jeju National University from July 2021 to April 2022. In May 2022, I was appointed as a postdoc with the research group Electrical Energy Systems (EES) at TU/e, the Netherlands. During my postdoc, I received the EUROTECH Visiting Research Program to visit and conduct research at the Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy Laboratory (WIRE), Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne(EPFL), Switzerland.</p>
<p>My research interests are AI, machine learning, deep learning, time series analysis, optimization, and prediction in power systems. Her research also expands to agricultural price forecasting and battery level classification.
My current research is on the web development of the electricity market game.</p>
